[suspenseful music playing]

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,520
-Hello.
-Hey.

4
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,320
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

CLEANER
PERENNA LUIS

6
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,400
Okay, everyone, let's move it.
We got a big night.

7
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,800
[Luis] So, this is the Queen's necklace?

8
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,320
Yeah.

9
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,240
Next week, it goes up for auction.
Probably gonna go for 20 million.

10
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,600
Well, shit.

11
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,640
It's okay, I'm sure you can afford it.

12
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
In a million years!

13
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,680
[both chuckle]

[indistinct chatter]

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,600
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

20
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,440
[coin rattles]

21
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,240
You look like shit, Assane.

22
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,000
You used to be so handsome.

23
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,800
-Can't you afford a razor?
-[Assane] Sure.

24
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,640
-I just got myself a job.
-You got a job?

25
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,840
Mm-hm.

26
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,040
-[woman] Oh, isn't that wonderful?
-Mm-hm.

27
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,080
[woman chuckles]

28
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,040
-Congratulations!
-[Assane] Thank you.

29
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,920
And what is it?

30
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,760
If I had to guess, I'd say

31
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,880
it's really complicated
and it won't last very long.

32
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,440
Same as usual.

33
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,520
It might be nice
if you stopped hiding things.

34
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,560
For us.

35
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
For our son.

36
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Can I see Raoul this weekend?

37
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,400
Of course you can see Raoul this weekend.

38
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,840
[distant siren wailing]

39
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,800
You think he's gonna want to see you?

40
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,080
-He's tired of being disappointed.
-I know I'm not the ideal father.

41
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,960
Well… Saturday at eight?

42
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,360
Saturday at eight.

43
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,480
-Things will change, Claire.
-Yeah, well, we'll see.

44
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,040
I'm gonna change.

45
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,400
[Claire] Tell that to your son.

46
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,040
[Assane] I know I'm a bit late
for the alimony, but…

47
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,680
[Claire] Keep your money.
Buy a present for Raoul.

48
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
See you Saturday.

49
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,200
Don't be late.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
[soft music playing]

51
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,720
[distant horns blaring]

52
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,640
[Claire sighs softly]

53
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
[up-tempo music playing]

54
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,320
[men shouting in distance]

55
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,520
[knock at door]

56
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
-Who's there?
-It's Perenna.

57
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,240
Get in.

58
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,200
Got the money?

59
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,760
[Assane] There's a problem.
I don't have the cash.

60
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,880
I was wondering
if Vincent would be willing to--

61
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
-Oh! Hey!
-Come here.

62
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,320
-What are you doing? What do you want?
-[man] Out of the way, fucker!

63
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,360
[Assane] Hey! Wait, listen to me!
Wait, wait, wait. Vincent!

64
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,400
Listen to me!

65
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,200
-Oh, shit! Wait!
-[Vincent] Where's my money?

66
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,840
[Assane] I don't have it.
I gave it to my kid's mom.

67
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,880
Oh! Oh, please. Give me more time.
Give me more time.

68
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,480
Interesting.
Maybe we should visit your kid's mom.

69
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,640
No!

70
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,320
Fuck! Don't let me fall!

71
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Pull me up and I'll tell you
how to make some cash. A bunch of cash.

72
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,520
More money
than you'll ever be able to spend.

73
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,160
I'm afraid of heights.
You can't keep me hanging like this!

74
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,080
Right, Kevin, get him up.

75
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,280
[Assane groans]

76
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,280
[car tires screeching on TV]

77
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,280
I'm a janitor now.

78
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,040
At the Louvre.

79
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,760
-Sounds like a shitty job.
-[Assane] That depends.

80
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,480
The artwork I clean,
they're worth millions.

81
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,760
And they're within my reach.

82
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,720
-Every night.
-Okay, and how does this get me my money?

83
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,400
You'll get it.

84
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,840
<i>Next Friday,</i>
<i>a necklace will be put up for auction.</i>

85
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,280
<i>The necklace belonged to Marie-Antoinette</i>
<i>and it's worth millions.</i>

86
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,160
<i>Except the sale won't go</i>
<i>as planned because we…</i>

87
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,240
we're gonna steal it.

88
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,240
Okay, Kevin, throw him over.

89
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
[Kevin groaning]

90
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,240
-Fuck, seriously?
-You see? You underestimated me.

91
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,280
-[Kevin groans]
-You didn't look at me.

92
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,680
You saw me,

93
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,880
but you didn't really look.

94
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,080
-Just like they don't look.
-Who's "they"?

95
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,280
The people I work for,
everyone who lives on that side of town.

96
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,920
Everyone on top while we're at the bottom.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,160
They don't look.
And thanks to that, we're gonna be rich.

98
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,520
I need someone
who can be quick and decisive.

99
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,480
And someone with muscle.

100
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,120
And you need someone who knows the museum.

101
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,800
And what about me?

102
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,040
Oh, cool.

103
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,920
This is where the auction's held.
We gotta be careful.

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,600
There's cameras everywhere.

105
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,000
Only one place doesn't have cameras. Here.

106
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,360
Janitors' locker room. They don't think
there's anything valuable there.

107
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,680
A separate hallway.

108
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,200
<i>A separate entrance. A separate elevator.</i>

109
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,440
They don't want anyone to see us.

110
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,880
And that means they won't see you.

111
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,520
What do you mean, "you"?

112
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,720
You three go in as janitors
and come out millionaires.

113
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,160
And how do we get in?
Using our good looks?

114
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,200
-[Assane]<i> I'll get you in no problem.</i>
-Where's my badge? Shit.

115
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,680
The real question is,
how will you get out? They'll scan you.

116
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,960
Unless <i>you're taking out trash.</i>

117
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,920
<i>Or bringing in cleaning products.</i>

118
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,200
<i>Spray bottles can be filled with anything.</i>
<i>Bleach. Window cleaner.</i>

119
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,720
Or… chloroform.

120
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,920
When the auction starts,
you go to the locker room.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,560
There, Vincent and Kevin,
you'll steal the guards' uniforms.

122
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,880
You'll need 'em later.

123
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,680
And you, Rudy,
you go to the surveillance room.

124
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,919
<i>There's always one guy in there.</i>
<i>He's always sleeping.</i>

125
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,320
<i>So, nothing to worry about.</i>

126
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,840
<i>And then, you deactivate the cameras.</i>

127
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,360
<i>If the cameras are down for</i>
<i>over two minutes, the police are alerted.</i>

128
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,160
<i>Two minutes after that, they'll scramble.</i>
<i>In three minutes, they'll arrive.</i>

129
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,800
<i>Two plus two plus three.</i>

130
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,960
You have seven minutes not to get caught.

131
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,320
-What?
-It's tight.

132
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,600
But more than enough time
to get to the foyer

133
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,600
<i>where they keep the necklace</i>
<i>after it's sold.</i>

134
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,840
Grab the necklace and exit there,
and Rudy will be with the car.

135
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,640
A discreet, fast car
he will acquire for us.

136
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,160
And we're rich.

137
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,120
And here, observe all the pure gold
suspending a river of diamonds.

138
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,080
-Any questions?
-Any questions?

139
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,960
While we risk our asses,
what are you doing?

140
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,920
Who, me?

141
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,120
I'm buying the necklace.

142
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,560
[guide] Right, please follow me
for the rest of the tour. Thank you.

143
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,280
And this is where you work?

144
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,880
A big change from home!
Are your bosses cool?

145
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,400
Let's just say they're… presumptuous.

146
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,040
-"Presumptuous," Assane.
-Oh, Papa, seriously?

147
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,360
[dad] "Presumptuous."

148
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,080
P-R-E

149
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,280
S-U-M

150
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,600
P-T-U-O

151
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
U-S.

152
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,280
Bravo, my boy.

153
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
-[chuckles]
-[thunder rumbling]

154
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,680
[crack of thunder]

155
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,160
[engine spluttering]

156
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,520
[dad] Mrs. Pellegrini?

157
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,000
-Do you need some assistance?
-No.

158
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,240
No, no.

159
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Thank you.

160
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
It's me, madam.

161
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,320
I'm Babakar.

162
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,120
Your husband's new chauffeur.

163
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,960
Oh… I'm sorry.

164
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,640
Excuse me. I didn't recognize you.
I'm sorry. I've got a small problem.

165
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,440
Pop the hood for me, please.

166
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,360
All right.

167
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,200
Hey, get in!

168
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,680
Where are you and your dad from?

169
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,640
Senegal, madam. Close to Thiès.

170
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,840
And your mom?

171
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,320
[thunder rumbling]

172
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,120
[hood closes]

173
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,760
Try it now.

174
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,280
[engine starts]

175
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,880
Yeah, it's good!

176

-Let me drive you, madam.
-No, no, thank you.

178
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,080
No, I insist.

179
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,680
Well, then, all right.

180
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,360
Do you know
what they call men like your dad?

181
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,040
A gentleman.

182
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,600
Yeah, it's true.

183
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,640

-[Mrs. Pellegrini] It's true.

184

Here you go. Good luck.

203
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,240
[auctioneer]
The legendary Queen's necklace.

204
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,480
The fabulous necklace whose very history
is intertwined with the history of France.

205
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,880
A gift from Louis XVI to Marie-Antoinette,

206
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,000
it disappeared during the Revolution
before resurfacing,

207
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,760
two decades later,
in the hands of Napoleon

208
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
who gave it to Joséphine de Beauharnais.

209
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,440
Then began an incredible journey
across all of Europe,

210
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,320
from Tsarist Russia
to the Great Palace of Constantinople,

211
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,760
finally ending up
as one of the secret treasures

212
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
of the Third Reich.

213
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,640
It was then purchased by our dear friends,
the Pellegrinis,

214
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,840
from whom it was stolen 25 years ago.

215
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,200
[Babakar] After you, sir.

216
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,960
Open it.

217
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,760
Put the car in the garage.

218
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,120
-I don't want it in the rain.
-Of course, sir.

219
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,560
[auctioneer]
It was considered lost forever.

220
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,480
In reality, it had been dismantled

221
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,240
and the seven gemstones were scattered
to the four corners of the world.

222
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,480
But no one took into account
the tenacity of Hubert Pellegrini,

223
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,600
who tracked down every one of the gems.

224
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,240
And today, the reconstructed necklace
has finally returned home, here, in Paris.

225
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,040
Ladies and gentlemen, if you would,
please welcome the daughter of its owner,

226
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,880
the lovely Juliette Pellegrini.

227
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,720
[applause continues]

228
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,160
[Juliette] Good evening.

[Assane]
Mrs. Pellegrini said I could use the pool.

231
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,480
Are you the son of the guy
who drives my father?

232
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,160
My name's Juliette.

233
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Now you respond.
It's called a conversation.

234
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,040
My name's Assane.

235
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,240
How old are you, Assane?

236
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
[Assane] I'm 14.

237
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,200
Next week.

238
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,680
[Juliette chuckles]

239
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Tell me, Assane.

240
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,760
Is it true what they say about Blacks?

241
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,160
-What?
-[Juliette laughs]

242
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,280
What do you mean?

243
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,480
People say they can't swim.

244
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,079
-Well, I can swim.
-[Juliette] Oh, yeah?

245
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,240
Can I see?

246
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,240
If you swim to me, you get a kiss.

247
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,920
It'll be a real kiss.

248
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,720
Not like your mom's.

249
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,680
[applause]

250
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,520
[inaudible speech]

251
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
[Juliette] Thank you. Good evening.

252
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,640
When my father reconstructed
this necklace,

253
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,240
he promised
that he'd do something special.

254
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,440
That's why tonight, proceeds from the sale

255
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,840
will help create the Juliette
and Hubert Pellegrini Foundation.

256
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,280
The foundation will support
future cultural and artistic projects…

257
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,080
You have my thanks.

266
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,400
[auctioneer] Well, perhaps we can set
a starting bid of 18 million,

267
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,040
as a warm-up, if I may suggest.

268
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,520
Right, who wants to bid 18 million?
Do I have 18 million?

269
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600

00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,240
[audience gasping]

353
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,160
Did I hear you say 60 million euros?

354
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,400
Yes, you did.

355
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,040
Sixty million euros.
Sixty million euros? Very well, um…

356
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the hour of truth.

357
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,600
Sixty million euros.

358
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,080
-Ladies and gentlemen…
-I can't fucking breathe!

359
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,400
Do I have any other bidders
for the Queen's necklace?

360
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,120
No?

361
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,240
So, 60 million euros
for the gentleman going once…

362
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,880
Sixty million euros going twice…
Sixty million euros going thrice…

363
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,640
Sold to the gentleman. Well done!

364
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,800
Thank you.

365
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,960
Are you afraid he'll betray us?

366
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,320
He won't.

367
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,680
We'll do it first.

368
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,600
Thank you.

Five minutes!

372
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,800
[auctioneer] Everything seems to be
in order, so, thank you.

373
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,560
I must admit, Mr. Sernine, I wasn't
expecting someone like you as a buyer.

374
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,680
Like me?

375
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,640
What do you mean?

376
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,120
Well, I mean…

377
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,600
uh, well, so young!

378
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,840
[chuckles]

379
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,200
And here is your necklace.

380
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,040
Well, when your money transfer
is validated, of course.

381
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,280
Of course.

382
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,280
Mr. Pellegrini is very strict
about procedure.

383
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,480
In regards to that, his daughter
would like to meet you, in case you…

384
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,840
Uh… I don't think so.

385
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,080
Can I see it now?

386
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,160
For that price.

387
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,720
Just a little peek.

388
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,080
The necklace is my baby now.
You understand?

389
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,240
Of course.

390
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,560
All right.

391
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,680

-It's my pleasure.

[Hubert]
I always put the necklace inside the safe.

394
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,960
Can you get into this room? Yes or no?

395
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,280
Yes, but…

396
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,440
And you're well aware my safe is in here.

397
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,160
-No, I'm not.
-So you say.

398
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,480
I saw you lurking in here the other day.

399
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,560
I… I was dusting the bookshelves.

400
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,040
-Madam, you told me to--
-No, leave my wife out of this!

401
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,720
The truth is that Mr. Diop was found
in a precarious situation

402
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,520
which he pretends is an injustice.

403
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,120
To get revenge, he stole the necklace.

404
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,520
I swear on my son's life, I never--

405
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,440
-Who else was here?
-I have no idea!

406
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,480
Okay, calm down, sir.
At the station, we can clear this up.

407
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,000
-All right?
-Yeah, remove this, uh…

408
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,400
This what, huh?

409
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,120
-This what?
-[officer] Whoa. Calm down.

-Let go of me!

-Calm down, sir.
-I didn't do it!

412

-Let's go!
-[Babakar] Help me, Mrs. Pellegrini!

413
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,800
Tell my son!

414
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,200
I'm innocent!

415
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,640
Let me go!

416
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,240

There was a robbery. No one can leave.

Wait, let me check with Central.
